     <h1> 8 in 1 Double Classroom Project</h1>
     
        <p> Our major project for this year is the constrcution of 8 in 1 Double Classroom to replace our make-shift classrooms that is currently being used. 
        <p> In 2017, a local Building Board visited the school and condemned the entire buildings, resulting in school suspension for six weeks and demolition works began. The School Board of Management then mobilized resources and erected 19 make shifts classrooms and accommodates an average of 1,200 students. The school then endorsed a 5 year plan under its strategic plan to construct permanent building structures to replace the makeshifts which would be condemn by then. A year later, a timely assistance from Hon John Rosso erected a modernized 8 in 1 Double classroom which opened in the year 2020.  
        <br><br>Immediately after the construction of makeshift classrooms in 2018 the school BOM put to work its 5 year strategic plan and managed to save a substantial amount of money from the much needed proceeds from the Project Fee collection. According to the plan, the construction should commence by year 2024.

    <h1> Financial Constraints</h1>
        <p> In 2024, the school plans to proceed with its plan to construct the 8 in 1 Double Classroom however fall short by 30% of the total project costs. This was impacted by nonpayment of Project Fees which was largely influenced by the Governments' Tuition Fee-Free policy. Despite the odds, the Board proceeds with alternate plans to raise funds to meet the balance.</p> 
     
     <h1> 1st Fundraising Dinner</h1>
     
        <p>Our first Fundraising Dinner was held at the Lae International Hotel on the eve of July 13th 2024. We raised a total of K30,000 (which was much less than expected) from the supporting businesses and organizations. Most companies approached were unable to assist due to cash-flow issues due to the economic instability. In spite of the set-back, the school went ahead with its plan and commits the proceedings raised from the fundraising to Earth works and securing necessary permits to grant approval from the National Building Board to allow construction to proceed. </p>
